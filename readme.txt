This will help catch your visitors attention, and even improve your SEO, as the search engines will index the related page for more relevant content.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

* **Excerpt engine**. Because the algorythm will limit your article to your predefined number of sentences.

* **Featured images**. Can display the featured images or, if no featured image is set, can display the first available.
